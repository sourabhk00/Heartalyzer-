## Overview

The **Love Score Calculator** is a comprehensive algorithm designed to quantify the romantic potential and "chemistry" in chat conversations. By evaluating multiple dimensions of a conversationâ€”including speed of replies, emotional expressiveness, conversational balance, and activity regularityâ€”the algorithm generates a Love Score from **0 to 100%**.

This playful but insightful metric is perfect for dating apps, relationship analytics platforms, chatbots, or anyone interested in understanding and improving their digital relationships.

Designed and thoroughly documented by [Sourabh Kumar](https://github.com/sourabhk00), this project blends behavioral analysis with fun, actionable feedback. The algorithm is built for clarity, extensibility, and real-world impact.

## How the Love Score Works

The Love Score is calculated using five main factors. Each factor contributes (positively or negatively) to the overall score, which always starts from a base value. The final score is capped between 0 and 100.

### 1. Reply Time

**Measures how quickly participants respond to each other.**

- **Very fast replies (<2 min):** +25 points  
  *Indicates high interest, enthusiasm, and engagement. Fast replies often suggest a strong desire to keep the conversation flowing and the relationship moving forward.*
- **Fast replies (<5 min):** +15 points  
- **Good replies (<10 min):** +10 points  
- **Okay replies (<30 min):** +5 points  
- **Slow replies (30+ min):** -15 points  
  *May indicate distraction, lack of interest, or competing priorities. Slow replies can reduce conversational momentum and emotional connection.*

**Why it matters:** Quick replies show attentiveness and prioritization, helping to build trust and excitement in the relationship.

### 2. Emoji Usage

**Measures the emotional expressiveness in the conversation.**

- **Lots of emojis (>0.5 per message):** +20 points  
  *High emoji use signals strong emotional investment, playfulness, and a willingness to express feelings openly. Emojis add warmth and personality to chats.*
- **Good amount (>0.2):** +15 points  
- **Some (>0.1):** +10 points  
- **A few (>0.05):** +5 points  

**Why it matters:** Emojis can convey affection, humor, and empathy, transforming text-based chats into lively, emotionally rich exchanges.

---

### 3. Message Balance

**Assesses whether both participants are equally active in the conversation.**

- **Very balanced (>45%/55% split):** +15 points  
  *Represents mutual interest and healthy conversational dynamics. Both sides feel equally heard and valued.*
- **Balanced (>35%):** +10 points  
- **Slightly imbalanced (>25%):** +5 points  
- **Imbalanced (â‰¤25%):** -10 points  
  *One-sided conversations may signal disengagement or a lack of reciprocity, which can hinder relationship growth.*

**Why it matters:** Balanced communication fosters trust, respect, and emotional safety, all of which are critical for lasting relationships.

---

### 4. Activity Consistency

**Measures how regularly the chat is active over time.**

- **Very consistent (>80% of days active):** +15 points  
  *Indicates strong ongoing interest and a healthy habit of staying in touch. Consistency helps maintain emotional connection and momentum.*
- **Consistent (>50%):** +10 points  
- **Somewhat consistent (>30%):** +5 points  

**Why it matters:** Frequent and regular communication is a cornerstone of relationship building, especially in the digital age.

---

### 5. Base Score & Final Calculation

- **Base Score:** All chats start at 50 points.
- **Total Score:** Add or subtract points from the above categories.
- **Final Score:** Clamp the value between 0 (minimum) and 100 (maximum).

**Interpretation:**  
- **High Love Score (80â€“100):** Fast, balanced, emoji-rich, and regular conversationsâ€”hallmarks of a thriving relationship!
- **Medium Love Score (50â€“79):** Decent romantic potential, but could benefit from more engagement or expressiveness.
- **Low Love Score (<50):** Indicates areas needing improvement, such as responsiveness, balance, or frequency.

## Example Calculation

Suppose a chat exhibits:
- **Reply Time:** Replies in 3 minutes â†’ +15 points
- **Emoji Usage:** 0.25 emojis per message â†’ +15 points
- **Message Balance:** 48%/52% split â†’ +15 points
- **Activity Consistency:** Active 60% of days â†’ +10 points
- **Base Score:** 50 points

**Calculation:**  
50 (base)  
+ 15 (reply)  
+ 15 (emoji)  
+ 15 (balance)  
+ 10 (consistency)  
= **105** â†’ Final Love Score: **100** (capped at 100)
